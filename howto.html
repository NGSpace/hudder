<h2>Creating the hud</h2>
<style>
	ol li {
		margin-top: 0px;
		margin-bottom: 10px;
	}
</style>
<hr>
<ol>
	<li>Locating your hudder config folder: you can do this simply by going to Hudder's options menu and clicking the text at the
	bottom of "general". After that your file explorer should open up with Hudder's config folder!</li>
	
	<li>Creating the hudder file: Simply create a file (or use one that already exists [don't modify hud.json!]), open it in your
	preferred editor (let's be honest it's prob notepad) and start writing!</li>
	
	<li>Open Hudder's options menu and make sure that the "main file" option is set to your hud file's name.</li>
	
	<li>Step 4 - Start writing your hud!</li>
</ol>


<h1>Actually writing the hud</h1>
<hr><br>
<h2 id="text">Normal text</h2>
<hr><br>
You just write it, writing "words are beautiful" in the file will show "words are beautiful" in game.
<br><br>
<h2 id="color">Character escaping and Color Codes</h2>
<hr><br>

Most of what you'll write will probably be normal text, variables, conditions etc. But in some cases you'll want to use reserved
characters (';','%','#','&','{') as normal text (ex. you want to use '%' without Hudder considering it a condition). In those cases
you'll need to add a backslash before the character (ex. '\%').
<br><br>
Color codes work as minecraft intended.

<br><br>

<h2 id="sections">Text sections</h2>
<hr><br>

You want to put text in the bottom right corner instead of top left? no problemo! use sections like
<inline-code>;bottomright;</inline-code> (note that only text after it will be affected)

<br><br>

<h2 id="variables">Basic variables (fps, memory usage etc)</h2>
<hr><br>
Let's say you want to add some real basic stuff like an fps count and all that stuff, well it's pretty simple! all you need to do
is write the name of the variable between curly brackets and Hudder will do the rest!
(ex. <inline-code>{fps}</inline-code>, <inline-code>{used_memory}</inline-code> etc.)
<br><br>
A full list of variables can be found <a href="varlist.html">here!</a>

<br><br>

<h2 id="conditions">Basic conditions</h2>
<hr><br>
So, you got a fancy new FPS meter but it still doesn't feel quite right yet, you want to know when you need to buy a new computer
because your frame rate is 999 instead of 1000? Use conditions! Conditions have a real structureand if that structure is not followed
unexpected behavior can occur! But not to fear! I am here to help you understand them! Conditions are structured like this (Note there
is no limit to the number of else I just put 2 cuz I am lazy, could be 1, 2, 3, how many you possibly need):
<br><br>
<code>%condition 1, "condition 1 is true", condition 2, "condition 2 is true", "neither condition is true"%</code>
<br>Want some examples? well here ya go:
<br><br>
<inline-code>&%fps&#60;30, "4", fps&#60;60, "e", "a"%{fps}</inline-code> - This will show the fps meter in different colors depending if it's
below 30 or 60 fps.
<br><br>
<inline-code>%ping>5, "{ping}", ""%</inline-code> - This will show your ping only if it is above 5!
<br><br>
<inline-code>%is_slime, "Slime chunk!"%</inline-code> - This will show "Slime chunk!" if you are standing inside a slime chunk.

<br><br>

<h2 id="adv_variables">Advanced variables and Functions</h2>
<hr>
<note>Functions are available at Hudder version 5.0.0 or above!</note>
<note>Arrayes are available at Hudder version 5.5.0 or above!</note>

Let's do this one quickly:
<br><br>
Setting custom variable values - <inline-code>{variable=10}</inline-code> will set <inline-code>{variable}</inline-code> to 10.
<inline-code>{var=fps}</inline-code> will set var to your fps count.
<br>
Math - <inline-code>{math_result=fps+10+math_result}</inline-code> will do as you could've guessed, math.
use * for multiplications, / for divisions and % for remainder.
<br>
Functions - <inline-code>{math_result=length("text")+2}</inline-code> will set math_result to the length of the word "text" plus 2.
<br><br>
All of those could be used together if needed, you could pass a function to a function (ex. int(str(10)) which returns 10) until infinity, etc.
<br>
A full list of functions is provided <a href="functions.html">here!</a>
<br><br>

<h2 id="methods">Using methods</h2>
<hr><br>

you can use <inline-code>;[method], and, it's, parameters;</inline-code> to call builtin methods.they are built similar to conditions
except the parameters are not predefinied and can be variables (which can be changed as specified in the section above).
