	<note><span> I recommend you read the "Arrays" section of <a href="variables.html">[INSERT FINAL PAGE NAME]</a></span></note>
	<note>In the examples given here I use the default "hudder" language/compiler however things will mostly act the same in JavaScript</note>
	<h1 id="varray">Vertex array</h1>
	<hr>
	A vertex array specifies an unknown group of points on the screen that make up a full shape,<br>
	a point can be defined as x (horizontal) position and y (horizontal) position.<br><br>
	A vertex array (in hudder) is structured as the following:<br>
	<code>[x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3, x4, y4, x5, y5...]</code><br>
	
	<b>Example:</b>
	<code>;colorvertices, [20, 20, 5, 40, 20, 60, 35, 40], 0xFFFFFFFF;</code>
	Will draw a white diamond in the top left corner of the screen:<br>
	<img src="Images/whitediamond.png" width="40%">
	
	<h3>More than four points?</h3>
	Hudder draws in fours, each element on screen is made up of four points,<br>
	if not enough points are provided or left in an array, the element will be discarded.
	
	you may add as many points as you wish, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, etc.
	<br><br>
	<h1 id="tarray">Texture/UV points array</h1>
	<hr>
	A texture array is similar to a vertex array but instead of defining the positions of the shapes,<br>
	it defines the points of a texture you wish to be rendered.<br><br>
	
	In a texture array points are defined from 0 to 1 rather than pixel positions, 0 being the top or the left, 1 being the bottom or the right.<br>
	Example:
	<code>;textureVertices, "Textures/selection.png", [0, 0, 0, 20, 20, 20, 20, 0],  [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0];</code>
	Will draw the selection image built into Hudder in the top left:<br>
	<img src="Images/squareselection.png" width="40%"><br>
	
	<br><br>
	<h1 id="con">"Continous" rendering</h1>
	<hr>
	While the default methods render using "Quads" draw mode, when using the continous versions of those methods (Check the Lists) Hudder draws with the "Triangle strip" draw mode<br>
	which allows for easier drawing of more complex shapes.<br><br>
	
	Unlike the Quads draw mode, this draw mode draws elements with 3 points instead of 4 ("TRIANGLE strip").<br>
	The quirk of this mode is that for every point you add after the 3rd, the previous points will be used as the 2 other points.<br>
	This means that you don't have to unnecessarily redefine the previous points, taking up more memory, complexity and compute time.<br><br>
	An example of the continous rendering can be found in the next section:<br>
	
	<br><br>
	<h1 id="circle">Drawing a circle</h1>
	<hr>
	Using continous rendring you can easily draw a circle by looping 360 times and defining a point at the perimeter of the circle<br>
	And then defining another point in the center of the circle, eventually completing the circle:
	<code>{radius=10}
{circlex=10}
{circley=10}
{degrees=360}
{circlecolor=0xFFFFFFFF}

{arr=[]}
{i=0}
#while i&#60;degrees+1
	{theta = 2* 3.141592653589793 * i / 360}
	{xr=radius * cos(theta)}
	{yr=radius * sin(theta)}
	{arr[i*4]=xr + circlex}
	{arr[i*4+1]=yr + circley}
	{arr[i*4+2]=circlex}
	{arr[i*4+3]=circley}
	{i=i+1}
;colorvertices_con, arr, circlecolor;
</code>
